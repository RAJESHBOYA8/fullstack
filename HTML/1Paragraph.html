            This is a paragraph. It contains text that is grouped together to form a coherent thought or idea. Paragraphs are used to break up text into manageable sections, making it easier to read and understand.

            Each paragraph should focus on a single topic or idea, and it typically begins with an indentation or a line break to separate it from the previous paragraph.
